                <h3>MIXING</h3>
                <p>Mixing is the technique of blending all of the individual tracks in a recording to create a version
                    of
                    the song that sounds as good as possible. This is called "the mix”.
                <p>The process can be comprised of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Balancing the levels of the tracks that have been recorded</li>
                    <li>Fine-tuning the sound of each instrument or voice using equalization (EQ)</li>
                    <li>“Panning” the tracks between speakers to create a stereo image</li>
                    <li>Adding reverb, compression, and other effects to enhance the original recording</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Mixing sometimes includes a bit of editing – choosing the best bits of every take of a song, and
                    sometimes
                    even building musical elements from scratch. Sometimes there is so much editing involved it forms a
                    separate
                    stage in between tracking and mixing.</p>
                </p>

                <h3>MASTERING</h3>
                <p>
                    Mastering is the process of turning a song or collection of songs into a final master for
                    manufacturing
                    so
                    that it translates well across systems: CD player, radio, computer, car stereo, phone, etc.
                <p>The process involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Balancing the level and tonal balance (EQ) of songs</li>
                    <li>Controlling the dynamic range - how loud and quiet each section is, for the right musical
                        balance of
                        variety and power</li>
                    <li>Compressing, EQing, M/S Processing and Limiting so the song is polished</li>
                    <li>Creating a secure, reliable manufacturing master, including PQ information, UPC/EAN codes,
                        ISRCs,
                        CD-Text</li>
                </ul>


                <p>This can vary from being a very subtle process, involving minor tweaks to polish the existing mixes,
                    to
                    occasionally being a complete rescue mission for problem songs, or where detailed restoration is
                    needed.
